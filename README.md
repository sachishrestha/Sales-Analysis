# Sales-Analysis
This repository consists of Electronic Device Sales Store data analysis. 
#### Packages used were:
      . pandas
      . os
      . matplotlib
      . itertools
#### Firstly, 12 months worth of sales data were merged into one file and the data was cleaned by droping NaN rows and deleting null cells.
#### Set questions were created to guide the projects:
      The questions were:
      . What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
      . What city had the highest number of sales?
      . What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying products?
      . What products are most often sold together?
      . What product sold the most? why do you think it sold the most?
      
#### With the help of Matplotlib, the concluded informations were graphically represented.
